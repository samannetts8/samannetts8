# üëã Hi there, I'm Sam Annetts üëã

I'm a passionate software developer with half a decade in the financial sector. However, I realized that while the industry offered stability, it didn‚Äôt fulfill my passion for innovation and problem-solving. As such, I have retrained to begin a new career path as a software developer to better pursue my passion of building creative, technical solutions that address real-world challenges.

I developed a full-stack web application using Flask and React to scan images of wine lists or bottles and retrieve vintage details, including Vivino critic scores. The Python-based backend, built with Flask, processes API requests and integrates Tesseract OCR for precise text extraction from uploaded images. To gather and store wine data, I implemented web scraping with Beautiful Soup to parse HTML sources and used Supabase‚Äôs PostgreSQL database for efficient data management, ensuring seamless storage and remote access.

On the front end, I engineered a dynamic user interface with React, emphasizing modularity and scalability through intuitive routing. The application‚Äôs polished design was achieved using Material UI components, offering users an effortless experience for uploading images and viewing results. This project combined OCR, cloud database integration, and responsive front-end design to deliver a tool that simplifies wine vintage research.

**[ShelfLife](https://shelf-life-opal.vercel.app/):**

##### *Vercel Deployment URL: [https://shelf-life-opal.vercel.app/](https://shelf-life-opal.vercel.app/) * #####

Developed during a one-week team hackathon, ShelfLife is a full-stack web app designed to minimize food waste by tracking expiry dates and generating AI-driven recipe suggestions. My contributions centered on backend development for recipe functionality, and managing DevOps via Docker containerization and Vercel deployment. The project tackled challenges like user authentication (simplified through Supabase‚Äôs built-in system) and dynamic ingredient categorization to ensure seamless user workflows.

The tech stack included Next.js with JavaScript scripting and modular styling via CSS Modules. Supabase hosted our scalable PostgreSQL database, while Playwright ensured end-to-end testing reliability. Deployment on Vercel leveraged native Next.js support, and tools like ESLint and Prettier maintained code consistency. By combining AI, cloud-native architecture, and responsive design, ShelfLife delivers an intuitive solution for reducing household food waste.

**[Say It In A Letter](https://postcard-generator-khaki.vercel.app/):**

##### *GitHub Repo URL: [https://github.com/samannetts8/Say-It-In-A-Letter](https://github.com/samannetts8/Say-It-In-A-Letter)* #####

Vercel Deployment URL: https://postcard-generator-khaki.vercel.app/

Built during a 24 hour hackathon, 'Say It In A Letter' is a React-based web app that lets users design custom digital postcards by adjusting text, backgrounds, fonts, and stickers via an interactive interface. The front end leverages React and JavaScript for dynamic state management using useState, while Babel and Node.js ensure cross-browser compatibility and streamlined dependency handling. Responsive CSS styling delivers a polished, mobile-friendly experience.

My role focused on core functionality: architecting the useState logic and prop drilling system to synchronize component states for real-time customization. I also tackled dynamic styling challenges, implementing state-driven className toggles through collaborative pair programming.
